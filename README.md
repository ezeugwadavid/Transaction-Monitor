## Technologies

ES6: See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) for details.

Babel: Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.  see [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/) for details.

React: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. see [here](https://reactjs.org/)

Styled Components: styled-components keeps track of which components are rendered on a page and injects their styles and nothing else, fully automatically. Combined with code splitting, this means your users load the least amount of code necessary. see [here](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics)

React-Boostrap: React-Bootstrap replaces the Bootstrap JavaScript. Each component has been built from scratch as a true React component, without unneeded dependencies like jQuery. As one of the oldest React libraries, React-Bootstrap has evolved and grown alongside React, making it an excellent choice as your UI foundation.. see [here](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/getting-started/introduction)
